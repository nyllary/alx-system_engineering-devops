Project 0x07. Networking Basics #0

Physical Layer: This layer deals with the physical transmission of data, including electrical signals, cables, and network hardware. It defines characteristics like voltage levels, cable types, and data rates.

Data Link Layer: Responsible for error detection, framing, and addressing within a local network. It ensures reliable communication between directly connected devices. Ethernet and Wi-Fi operate at this layer.

Network Layer: Handles routing and forwarding of data packets across different networks. IP (Internet Protocol) operates here, allowing devices to find the best path for data transmission.

Transport Layer: Ensures end-to-end communication reliability. It manages flow control, error correction, and segmentation of data. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols.

Session Layer: Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between devices. It manages dialog control and synchronization.

Presentation Layer: Responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data exchanged between applications is in a usable format.

Application Layer: The topmost layer where user applications interact with the network. It includes protocols like HTTP (for web browsing), SMTP (for email), and FTP (for file transfer).

Now, let’s address some of the other concepts:

LAN (Local Area Network): A LAN is a network within a limited geographical area, such as an office building or campus. It connects devices like computers, printers, and servers.

WAN (Wide Area Network): A WAN spans larger distances, connecting LANs across cities or countries. The internet itself is a global WAN.

IP Address: An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network. There are two types: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).
Localhost: Refers to the loopback address (127.0.0.1) used for testing network services on the same device.

Subnet: A portion of a larger network, created by dividing an IP address range. Subnets help manage network traffic efficiently.
TCP vs. UDP:
TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented protocol. It ensures data delivery and retransmits lost packets.
UDP: Connectionless protocol. It’s faster but doesn’t guarantee delivery; used for real-time applications like video streaming.
Port Numbers:
SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
HTTPS (HTTP Secure): Port 443
Device Connectivity Check:
Ping: A common tool/protocol to check if a device is connected to a network.
